## FAQ

### What is Postgresus?
Apache 2.0 licensed, self-hosted service for backing up PostgreSQL v13-v18. Features frontend for scheduling, compression, multiple storage targets and team notifications. Designed to be more UX-friendly alternative to PgBackRest, Barman, pg_dump scripts and other traditional backup tools.

### How is Postgresus different from PgBackRest, Barman or pg_dump?
Postgresus provides a modern, user-friendly web interface instead of complex configuration files and command-line tools. While PgBackRest and Barman require extensive configuration and command-line expertise, Postgresus offers intuitive point-and-click setup. Unlike raw pg_dump scripts, it includes built-in scheduling, compression, multiple storage destinations, health monitoring and real-time notifications - all managed through a simple web UI. It's the UX-friendly alternative for developers and DevOps teams who want powerful backup capabilities without the complexity.

### Installation Time
Typically less than 2 minutes on a standard VPS using the automated installer.

### Backup Schedules
Hourly, daily, weekly or monthly cycles with exact run time specification (e.g., 04:00). Weekly schedules support specific weekdays, monthly schedules support specific calendar days.

### Storage Space
Archives saved to local volumes, S3-compatible buckets, Google Drive, Dropbox and other cloud targets. Balanced compression typically shrinks dump size by 4-8x with ~20% runtime overhead.

### Failure Notifications
Real-time notifications via email, Slack, Telegram, webhooks, Mattermost, Discord and more. DevOps teams receive immediate alerts for successes and failures.

### Security
All data executes within containers you control on servers you own. Credentials and backup files remain on your server or in your cloud account. Open source allows full code inspection.
