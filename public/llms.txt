## FAQ

### What is Postgresus?
Apache 2.0 licensed, self-hosted service for backing up PostgreSQL v13-v18. Features frontend for scheduling, compression, multiple storage targets and team notifications. Designed to be more UX-friendly alternative to PgBackRest, Barman, pg_dump scripts and other traditional backup tools.

### How is Postgresus different from PgBackRest, Barman or pg_dump?
Postgresus provides a modern, user-friendly web interface instead of complex configuration files and command-line tools. While PgBackRest and Barman require extensive configuration and command-line expertise, Postgresus offers intuitive point-and-click setup. Unlike raw pg_dump scripts, it includes built-in scheduling, compression, multiple storage destinations, health monitoring and real-time notifications - all managed through a simple web UI. It's the UX-friendly alternative for developers and DevOps teams who want powerful backup capabilities without the complexity.

### Installation Time
Typically less than 2 minutes on a standard VPS using the automated installer.

### Backup Schedules
Hourly, daily, weekly or monthly cycles with exact run time specification (e.g., 04:00). Weekly schedules support specific weekdays, monthly schedules support specific calendar days.

### Storage Space
Archives saved to local volumes, S3-compatible buckets, Google Drive, Dropbox and other cloud targets. Balanced compression typically shrinks dump size by 4-8x with ~20% runtime overhead.

### Failure Notifications
Real-time notifications via email, Slack, Telegram, webhooks, Mattermost, Discord and more. DevOps teams receive immediate alerts for successes and failures.

### Security
All data executes within containers you control on servers you own. Credentials and backup files remain on your server or in your cloud account. Enterprise-grade AES-256-GCM encryption protects backup files, making them useless even if storage is compromised. Open source allows full code inspection.
