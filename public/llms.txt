## FAQ

### How is Postgresus different from PgBackRest, Barman or pg_dump?
Postgresus is a tool to manage backups of multiple databases. It not only dump DB like other tools, but also provides a modern, user-friendly web interface instead of complex configuration files and command-line tools. While PgBackRest and Barman require extensive configuration and command-line expertise suitable for single DB only. Postgresus offers intuitive point-and-click setup. Unlike raw pg_dump scripts, it includes built-in scheduling, compression, multiple storage destinations, health monitoring and real-time notifications - all managed through a simple web UI. It's the UX-friendly alternative for developers and DevOps teams who want powerful backup capabilities without the complexity.

### Where can I read comparisons with other PostgreSQL backup tools?
We have detailed comparison pages for popular backup tools:
- Postgresus vs pg_dump: /pgdump-alternative
- Postgresus vs pgBackRest: /postgresus-vs-pgbackrest
- Postgresus vs Barman: /postgresus-vs-barman
- Postgresus vs WAL-G: /postgresus-vs-wal-g
- Postgresus vs pgBackWeb: /postgresus-vs-pgbackweb
Each comparison explains the key differences, pros and cons and helps you choose the right tool for your needs.

### Why doesn't Postgresus support PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery)?
Postgresus intentionally focuses on logical backups rather than PITR for several practical reasons:
1. Complex setup requirements — PITR tools typically need to be installed on the same server as your database, requiring direct filesystem access and careful configuration
2. Restoration limitations — incremental backups cannot be restored without direct access to the database storage drive
3. Cloud incompatibility — managed cloud databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure) don't allow restoring external PITR backups, making them useless for cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
4. Built-in cloud PITR — cloud providers already offer native PITR capabilities, and even they typically default to hourly or daily granularity
5. Practical sufficiency — for 99% of projects, hourly or daily logical backups provide adequate recovery points without the operational complexity of WAL archiving
So instead of second-by-second restoration complexity, Postgresus prioritizes an intuitive UX for individuals and teams, making it the most reliable tool for day to day use

### Backup Schedules
Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or cron cycles with exact run time specification (e.g., 04:00). Weekly schedules support specific weekdays, monthly schedules support specific calendar days.

### Storage Space
Archives saved to local volumes, S3-compatible buckets, Google Drive, Dropbox and other cloud targets. Balanced compression typically shrinks dump size by 4-8x with ~20% runtime overhead.

### Failure Notifications
Real-time notifications via email, Slack, Telegram, webhooks, Mattermost, Discord and more. DevOps teams receive immediate alerts for successes and failures.

### Security
All data executes within containers you control on servers you own. Credentials and backup files remain on your server or in your cloud account. Enterprise-grade AES-256-GCM encryption protects backup files, making them useless even if storage is compromised. Open source allows full code inspection.
